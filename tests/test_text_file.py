---# Preamble
---
---This is a reference manual, not a tutorial. This means that we discuss changes
---relative to traditional *TeX* and also present new functionality. As a consequence
---we will refer to concepts that we assume to be known or that might be explained
---later.
---
---The average user doesn't need to know much about what is in this manual. For
---instance fonts and languages are normally dealt with in the macro package that
---you use. Messing around with node lists is also often not really needed at the
---user level. If you do mess around, you'd better know what you're dealing with.
---Reading ‚ÄúThe *TeX* Book‚Äù by Donald Knuth is a good investment of time
---then also because it's good to know where it all started. A more summarizing
---overview is given by ‚Äú*TeX* by Topic‚Äù by Victor Eijkhout. You might
---want to peek in ‚ÄúThe *e-TeX* manual‚Äù and documentation about *PDF*TEX.
---
---But \\unknown\\ if you're here because of *Lua*, then all you need to know is that
---you can call it from within a run. The macro package that you use probably will
---provide a few wrapper mechanisms but the basic `directlua` command that
---does the job is:
---
---```
---\\directlua{tex.print("Hi there")}
---```
---
---You can put code between curly braces but if it's a lot you can also put it in a
---file and load that file with the usual *Lua* commands.
